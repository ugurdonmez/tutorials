 
Given an mxn matrix, design a function that will print out the contents of the matrix in spiral format.

Spiral format means for a 5x5 matrix given below:

[ 1 2 3 4 5 ]
[ 6 7 8 9 0 ]
[ 1 2 3 4 5 ]
[ 6 7 8 9 0 ]
[ 1 2 3 4 5 ]

path taken is:

[ > > > > > ]
[ > > > > v ]
[ ^ ^ > v v ]
[ ^ ^ < < v ]
[ < < < < < ]

where ">" is going right, "v" going down, "<" is going left, "^" is going up.
