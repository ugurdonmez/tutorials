Given N integer array, I want to fill the array with product of all numbers except the number in that cell.
What is the complexity ? Do not worry about 0's or negative numbers in the array.
[Interviewer was more interested in how the multiplication/division gets effected as number of bits required to represent the intermediate products increases.]
